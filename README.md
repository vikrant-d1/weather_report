## Getting started

Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.

Install dependencies: **Run npm install** to install all the necessary dependencies for your project. This will read the dependencies listed in the package.json file and install them locally.

Start the development server: **Run npm start** to start the development server. This will compile your TypeScript code and start the application on a local server.

Open the application: Once the development server has started, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your application running.

You can now make changes to your code and see them reflected in the browser. If you need to create a production build, you can run npm run build which will create an optimized production build in the build directory. You can then serve this build with a web server of your choice.
